## Slide 2
Animation means freedom for me
Its like i combine travel and fun with everything
The feeling when you stand in front of thousands of people and everyone laughs, applauds, praises you is priceless

## Slide 3
You will meet new people who are on the same page as you and will support you in all situations
You overcome some of your life boundaries and move on
You live in five star hotels
You travel for free and have a million memories for the rest of your life
You will advance in languages and learn new ones.

## Slide 4 
You are away from your family and friends for several months
Little financial reward 
Living in a five star hotel, but in backstage
You dont get much sleep. You sometimes work in extreme conditions

## Slide 5 
casting
I had to go through a casting
Where we had to show emotions like JOY, SADNESS, ANGER
We had to put on different shows
We had to dance animated dances

## Slide 6 
Training
Before leaving for your season, we had to go through intensive training where our skills were tested
We trained first aid, sports activities with adults and children. We danced, we sang. They tried water activities like aquagym, water polo
At the end of the training, they told us where they would assign us

## Slide 7
The first plan was to go to the island Kos as a fitness, sports and choreographer animator. 
Unfortunately, there was a problem with the hotel.
And so i went to greece to an island called Rhodes as a childrens allround animator.
The hotel was really beautiful and big named rhodos princess beach
Here are the photos of the hotel

## Slide 8
As i already said, we lived in a five star hotel, but as animators we slept here.

## Slide 9 
Our team was really big, there were  of us
Of that we were only 2 czechs, one french, one german, but 16 italians
So learning italian was necessary because italians really dont speak english well
So this was my family and home for 4 months

## Slide 10
We worked from 10 to 11:30 and then from 3 to 5
Children from all over the world came to our club. Aged 3-15 years old. 
In the miniclub we spoke czech, english, german, russian, french, italian
We played with the children, painted, made something, danced…

## Slide 11
All round animator means animator for everything. 
When needed, i went to sports, fitness, invited people to show
![Snímek11](https://github.com/nikyabrahamova/story/assets/148855906/ce28a621-26a8-4494-9222-0b3fbbf3e0ae)

## Slide 12
Its bullshit because even if you have free time and want to sleep, you cant because even if its like 45 degrees outside, at 12 oclock you have to stand on a black surface and practice, or in a backstage without air conditioning
![Snímek12](https://github.com/nikyabrahamova/story/assets/148855906/90d0f703-9cea-473b-a9de-8b34913f1e35)

## Slide 13
Evening program for children.
It takes one hour. 
Animators from the mini club are dancing or other animators who have to dance.
![Snímek13](https://github.com/nikyabrahamova/story/assets/148855906/cf8fcec1-ba2a-48d6-97c9-b9bde1ca2716)

## Slide 14

## Slide 15
Day off the best day of the week when the animator can do whatever he wants. 
We went on trips, we went to parties, we went on a boat, we went to the beach.
Just a great day
![Snímek15](https://github.com/nikyabrahamova/story/assets/148855906/b6acbdff-1912-4f47-8ba7-dc369adb6257)

![Snímek16](https://github.com/nikyabrahamova/story/assets/148855906/03146209-2b7f-423c-9ecf-7fc8075686b8)

## Slide 17
It was terrible hot and the island caught fire
It was all going to end soon, so we werent worried
The fire was 30 minutes away by car. And no tree around us
Unfortunately a strong wind started blowing and the fire was getting closer to us
He moved so fast that he reached our garden
![Snímek17](https://github.com/nikyabrahamova/story/assets/148855906/487d7df8-9b20-434f-ab4d-85d1944bf580)

## Slide 18
Only when the garden caught fire did they start to evacuate us and our guests
We ran along the water and as far away from the fire as possible
Nobody had any things, no information and we just saw the fire burning more and closer to us and so we ran and ran
They managed to save the hotel guests from the fire, but they left the animators and cooks to continue fighting
We had no food, no drink, we didnt know what to do, we slept on the beach or ran away.
![Snímek18](https://github.com/nikyabrahamova/story/assets/148855906/6afebc3e-e1e3-462c-9257-3fd4ba4830a1)

## Slide 19
We finally got to safety when we stole a car and drove througt the fire to safety.
We slowly got together, because during the fire the whole team got separated.

## Slide 20
We ended up sleeping here. Without things but satisfied that we all live.
In the and, we were deported back to the czech republic for psychological and healts reasons.

## Slide 21
For the next months i continued in lipno nad vltavou and Špindlerův mlýn.
It was completely different.
There was less work, but less fun.
There is easy edit of rhodos and then lipno.
